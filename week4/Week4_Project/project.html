            <h3>The Black Unicorn</h3>

            <p> Introducing The Black Unicorn! This Vodka based drink is sure to give you the poise and feistiness of the gracious Libra. The Black Unicorn is 
            methodically sweetened with Grenadine and splashed with the flavor of Rum. Like a Libra, the Vodka is balanced with a smooth texture that sophistically
            enriches the flavors and darkens the beverage, exuding a dark yet sweet illustration. Like a Libra, this diplomatic ebony, red
            drink impersonates the eloquence and graciousnes of wine but can be very dangerous when taken lightly.</p>

            <h3>The Yaya Rita</h3>

            <p>This drink is a personal favorite. The Yaya Rita is named after yours truly. This margarita is based on the powerful and energizing qualities of Hennessey cognac.
            The Yaya Rita is a show-starter and demands to be the center of attention. This margarita lightens up your taste buds and consumes you with a burst of sweet flavors and 
            enriching textures. The Yaya Rita is nurturing and caring, until you consume all of what it has to offer. Like a cancer the the Yaya Rita is persuasive and cunning. This margarita
            seems easy and stable, then it will send you on your own emotional rollercoaster.

            <h3>The Minion</h3>

            <p>Loyal, whimsical, warm-hearted, and reliable. This may sound like the traits of a Virgo, but what is being described are the 
            qualities of this month's newest addition, The Minion. This summer's sweet tea is admired by and based on the variety of smooth textures that are cemented in Whiskey. 
            The Minion's mild temperament is sizzled by the bold taste and carbonation of Ginger Ale. The Minon seems simple and easy to handle until it amuses your
            underestimation. Like a Virgo, the Minion sweet tea is patient and enjoys waiting....waiting until you feel comfortable, then it strikes.
